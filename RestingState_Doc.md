# Steps of resting state fMRI preprocessing in tvb-ukbb pipeline

This doc is to summarize the resting state fmri preprocessing in the tvb-ukbb pipeline. The resting state pipeline will use the outputs from structural pipeline (T1, brain-extracted T1 (after BET), linear and non-linear warp pf T1 to MNI space and binary mask of white matter in T1). The flow chart of the rs-fmri preprocessing is here:
